# Phase 4 Project Guidelines

## Learning Goals

- Build a full-stack project with a React frontend and a Rails backend

## Requirements
- Uses a Rails API backend with a React frontend.
- Has 4 models on the backend, includes the following: many-to-many, one-to-one, one-to-many
- Full CRUD actions (ex. GET on School, can SHOW User, tip, school, can DELETE Tip, PATCH Profile)
- Follows RESTful routing convention for backend routes.
- Multiple Active Record validations.
- Uses controller validations to alter back end json response to front end. Passes error messages to the front end and display them if the action fails.
- Updates front end state upon successful response from a POST, PATCH, or DELETE request.
- Has multiple client-side routes using React Router. Includes navigation bar.
- Implement authentication/authorization, including password protection. User can sign up with a new user account, log in to the site with a secure password and stay logged in via user ID in the session hash, and log out of the site.
- Uses the React hook useContext to persist logged in user object in front end state and avoid props drilling.

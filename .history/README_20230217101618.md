# Phase 4 Project Guidelines

## Learning Goals

- Build a full-stack project with a React frontend and a Rails backend

## Requirements
Use a Rails API backend with a React frontend.
Have at least three models on the backend, that include the following:
At least one reciprocal many-to-many relationship (implemented by using 2 has-many-through relationships). Note: in order to accomplish this, your project must include a joins table. This joins table must include a user submittable attribute.
Full CRUD actions for at least one resource. The update action should be implemented using a form that is pre-filled with existing values for the object. On submission of the form, the object should update. Note: Using a like button or similar will not meet the update requirement.
Minimum of create and read actions for EACH resource.
Follow RESTful routing convention for backend routes.
Active Record validations Links to an external site.must be present on your models for most attributes.
Use controller validations to alter back end json response to front end. The response should pass your object if the creation, update, or deletion succeeds. However, the response should pass error messages to the front end and display them if the action fails. HINT: Utilize record.errors.
Properly update front end state upon successful response from a POST, PATCH, or DELETE request. That is to say, you should NOT rely on another GET request or redirect to update front end state of your application.
Have at least three different client-side routes using React Router. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes. Follow RESTful convention where applicable.
Implement authentication/authorization, including password protection. A user must be able to:
sign up with a new user account,
log in to the site with a secure password and stay logged in via user ID in the session hash, and
log out of the site.
Use the React hook useContext to persist your logged in user object in front end state and avoid props drilling.
